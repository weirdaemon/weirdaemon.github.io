>Bruno had rollmop herrings as a starter. 'Now', he thought, 'anything is possible.' He had hardly done so when he realised that he was wrong. [...] Rollmops were clearly not the solution, but then again, had he chosen sea bass with fennel it would have been no different.

_--Michel Houellebecq,_ Atomised

Increasingly I feel like nothing is possible. Typically if you ask me what the substance of my day-to-day experience is, I'm probably going to tell you 'nothing'. I'm big on exaggeration, but it would be true to say that my life seems to have the quality of a dream, and I'm not certain it's a good one. I have a creeping sense that I've done something wrong, or that I'm being continually pursued. Social life is actually painful to a greater or lesser extent, and I have a sense that my consciousness is less a limitless and luminous space than a cast-iron walnut shell out of which I can only catch glimpses of human experience. I knew something had to change when I became conscious that I'd invoked Alasdair Gray by literally mumbling the word 'useless' to myself as I walked down the street recently. I feel it's long past time to make some sense of this bizarre situation.

On some level it's fair enough that this is the case. It's been almost two years since my life took on a positively nightmarish quality, just in time for the last two years of my bachelor's degree. I was alternately completely alone and surrounded by strangers; thunderously hammering out a program at the last minute and frittering my time away on the internet; lying wide awake in bed and lying on a low-pile carpet in the computer science building, exhausted from days without sleep. Often the only sensory input I was conscious of was my fingertips on a mouse button or keycap. It was the anaesthetic life, and I answered the question of whether it was worth living by resenting it and wishing it gone. And now it *is* gone, I want to start again.

A daemon is a program that runs in the background without requiring any intervention from the user. Ideally you want your demons to also be daemons: they tick along relatively harmlessly in the background and don't present themselves to the user by causing chaos in your life and making marks that you can never take back. I'm presently looking at trying to make this the case, and part of that effort is this blog; if it makes me less dour in person, less likely to miss an opportunity to actually love those I nominally love, then by all means I'll put my thoughts to you instead of the people in my actual life.

I'll let you know how it goes.
