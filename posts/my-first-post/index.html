[&mldr;] Rollmops were clearly not the solution, but then again, had he chosen sea bass with fennel it would have been no different.</p></blockquote><p><em>&ndash;Michel Houellebecq,</em> Atomised</p><hr><p>Increasingly I feel like nothing is possible. Typically if you ask me what the substance of my day-to-day experience is, I&rsquo;m probably going to tell you &rsquo;nothing&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m big on exaggeration, but it would be true to say that my life seems to have the quality of a dream, and I&rsquo;m not certain it&rsquo;s a good one. I have a creeping sense that I&rsquo;ve done something wrong, or that I&rsquo;m being continually pursued. Social life is actually painful to a greater or lesser extent, and I have a sense that my consciousness is less a limitless and luminous space than a cast-iron walnut shell out of which I can only catch glimpses of human experience. I knew something had to change when I became conscious that I&rsquo;d invoked Alasdair Gray by literally mumbling the word &lsquo;useless&rsquo; to myself as I walked down the street recently. I feel it&rsquo;s long past time to make some sense of this bizarre situation.</p><p>On some level it&rsquo;s fair enough that this is the case. It&rsquo;s been almost two years since my life took on a positively nightmarish quality, just in time for the last two years of my bachelor&rsquo;s degree. I was alternately completely alone and surrounded by strangers; thunderously hammering out a program at the last minute and frittering my time away on the internet; lying wide awake in bed and lying on a low-pile carpet in the computer science building, exhausted from days without sleep. Often the only sensory input I was conscious of was my fingertips on a mouse button or keycap. It was the anaesthetic life, and I answered the question of whether it was worth living by resenting it and wishing it gone. And now it <em>is</em> gone, I want to start again.</p><p>A daemon is a program that runs in the background without requiring any intervention from the user. Ideally you want your demons to also be daemons: they tick along relatively harmlessly in the background and don&rsquo;t present themselves to the user by causing chaos in your life and making marks that you can never take back. I&rsquo;m presently looking at trying to make this the case, and part of that effort is this blog; if it makes me less dour in person, less likely to miss an opportunity to actually love those I nominally love, then by all means I&rsquo;ll put my thoughts to you instead of the people in my actual life.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2022 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
